# ADDRESS BOOK

Project built for Epicodus' intermediate JavaScript course to learn object, constructor and prototype use. It can save contact info (names, phone number, email, address). Not all functionality was created by the authors, most of the structure was taken from the course.

### Set-up/Use
Open the file and use input fields to enter contact information. Once entered it will display beneath the form. You can click on each contact to have it displayed, and have the option of deleting contacts as well.
